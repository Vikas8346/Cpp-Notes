// The foreach Loop
// There is also a "for-each loop" (introduced in C++ version 11 (2011), which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array (or other data sets):

// Syntax
// for (type variableName : arrayName) {
//   // code block to be executed
// }
// The following example outputs all elements in an array, using a "for-each loop":

// Example
// int myNumbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
// for (int i : myNumbers) {
//   cout << i << "\n";
